CnotiMind is a library made in C++/Qt Framework and Objective-C.

There are two directories,
src_qt -> C++/Qt version
src_ios -> Objective-C version for iOS devices

Several ideias are based on the FAtiMA project from INESC-ID, but we made many simplifications.

We also included support for a better memory management and handling

This library is part of the LIREC project. More information:
